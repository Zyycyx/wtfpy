### THIS MODULE IS CREATED TO:
  - TRACK VARIABLES
  - SEARCH IN VARIABLES
  - HELP UNIT TESTING
  - MODIFY VARIABLES AND LOG MODIFICATIONS
  - MAKE EASY THE MEMORY MANAGEMENT AND
  -	GATHERING INFORMATION FROM MEMORY

# AND HERE COMES THE MATTER!

## VERSION: A0.1.BETA
### FUNCTIONS
```python
	import wtf as W

  W.VHL # VariableHandler
	W.VHL.CNDB(VARIABLE, STOREDNAME) # CREATE NEW DATA BLOCK
	W.VHL.GADB() # GET ALL DATA BLOCKS
	W.VHL.SSDB(STOREDNAME) # SELECT SINGLE DATA BLOCK

	W.GCAI() # GET CREDITS AND INFORMATION
	W.GRDV(VARIABLE, NAME) # GET RUNTIME DATA VALUE
	W.SRDV(VARIABLE, NEWVALUE) # SET RUNTIME DATA VALUE
	W.MEMADDR(VARIABLE) # GET MEMORY ADDRESS OF A VARIABLE
	W.REFCHECK(FIRSTVARIABLE, SECVARIABLE) # CHECK IF TWO VARIABLES ARE REFERENCING TO THE SAME MEMORY ADDRESS
  W.GS(VARIABLE) # GET SIZE OF A VARIABLE
```
# DATA BLOCKS
Data blocks are stored in a 2D array with their
size, name(Set by user) and memory address.
I implemented a standard data block just to check
that it's working. You can remove it if you want.
This data block is 'STD'.
You can search inside this data block array, you
can delete blocks and add blocks.
